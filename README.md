# Secret Santa

The secret santa this year will be based on the [Pimoroni Badger 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040?variant=39752959852627).
The goal is to adjust the default image to the person who it is going to, as well as create a new application with inspirational quotes, that
can be randomly shuffled through.
Still not sure if this will be fun or not, but meh sounds kinda cool.

## Step 1: Retrieve quotes

The quotes will be found from goodreads.

## Step 2: Update built in badge

Useful command whilst developing to connect to board:

```bash
rshell -p /dev/tty.usbmodem101  --buffer-size 512
```

## Step 3: Quotes application
